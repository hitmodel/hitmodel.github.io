# Hybrid Intelligence Teams (HIT Model)

**The Future Operating Model for AI-Native Organizations**

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains the complete documentation for the **Hybrid Intelligence Teams (HIT) Model** - a new organizational framework for building AI-native teams where domain experts and AI specialists work together as a single cognitive unit.

The HIT Model is not a set of tools or an isolated methodology, but an **organizational model** that redefines the concept of teams in the AI era.

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### What is a HIT?

A **Hybrid Intelligence Team** is an organizational unit designed to operate in an AI-native context, where collaboration between humans and AI systems is not an addition but the founding principle of the structure itself.

### Core Pillars

1. **Domain Expertise**: Deep knowledge of a sector, market, or operational context
2. **AI Expertise**: Advanced understanding of AI models, their limitations, and how to orchestrate human-AI interaction

### Key Roles

- **Domain Lead**: Expert with deep sector knowledge who guides problem definition
- **AI Lead**: Architect of cognitive flows who orchestrates AI systems
- **Hybrid Operators**: Professionals operating at the intersection of domain and AI

---

## 💼 Business Applications

The HIT Model can be monetized through:

1. **Premium B2B Consulting** (€5k-100k per engagement)
2. **HIT as a Service** (team-as-a-service offering)
3. **Framework Licensing** (license to consultancies and integrators)
4. **Training & Certification** (courses and professional certifications)
5. **Digital Products** (playbooks, toolkits, templates)
6. **Thought Leadership** (speaking, advisory, partnerships)
7. **SaaS Platform** (software to orchestrate HITs)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Organizations
Identify a high-complexity area where a HIT pilot team can be tested. Compose a team of 3-5 people with hybrid skills, define a clear objective, and measure results.

### For Consultants
Study the HIT Model as a proprietary framework to offer to clients. Build competencies, documentation, and use cases. Position yourself as an expert in AI-native teams.

### For Founders
If you're building a new organization, design teams from the start as HITs. Don't add AI to existing structures: build AI-native structures.
