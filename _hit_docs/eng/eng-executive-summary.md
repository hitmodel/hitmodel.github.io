## **Executive Summary**

The adoption of artificial intelligence in organizations is accelerating, but the results achieved often fall short of expectations. Despite the introduction of increasingly powerful tools, many companies continue to experience inefficiencies, slow decision-making, and a growing misalignment between technology and business value. The problem does not lie in the quality of AI, but in how it is integrated into work teams.

Most organizations treat AI as a tool to be added to existing structures. This approach assumes that traditional team models are still adequate and that AI can simply "enhance" them. In reality, artificial intelligence is not just another software: it introduces a new type of cognitive capability that profoundly changes how decisions are made, problems are modeled, and work is executed.

The **Hybrid Intelligence Teams (HIT) Model** was born to address this structural change. HIT is not a set of tools, nor an isolated operational methodology. It is an **organizational model** that redefines the very concept of a team in the AI era, starting from a key principle: value does not come from the use of artificial intelligence per se, but from the **systematic fusion of domain expertise and AI expertise** within work units designed from the beginning to operate in a hybrid way.

A Hybrid Intelligence Team is composed of professionals with deep knowledge of the relevant domain and figures with advanced skills in AI, automation, and problem modeling, supported by artificial intelligence systems that act as true cognitive teammates. In this model, AI does not replace human work nor is it limited to automating it: it amplifies the team's ability to understand complex contexts, explore solutions, make decisions, and scale execution.

The HIT Model introduces a new team architecture, a specific operational cycle, and success metrics different from traditional ones. The focus shifts from individual productivity to the **team's collective intelligence**, from execution speed to decision-making speed, and from the number of resources employed to the quality of the result obtained per unit of complexity.

This white paper presents the HIT Model as a foundational framework for organizations that want to operate effectively in an AI-native context. It analyzes the limitations of current team models, defines the architecture of Hybrid Intelligence Teams, illustrates their operational cycle, and outlines the strategic benefits derived from their adoption. The goal is not to provide a universal recipe, but to offer a conceptual and operational lens through which to rethink the structure of work and collaboration in the age of artificial intelligence.

The future of work will not be defined by those who use more AI, but by those who know how to build teams designed to think, decide, and execute in a hybrid way. The HIT Model represents a first step in this direction.
