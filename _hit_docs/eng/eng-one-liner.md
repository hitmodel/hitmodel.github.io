Perfect.
An **official one-liner** must be: **clear, memorable, reusable everywhere** (cover page, slide 1, LinkedIn bio, pitch).

I propose **3 versions**, in order of strategic maturity.
The **first is the primary one** (recommended).

---

## ✅ **Official One-liner (Primary)**

**Hybrid Intelligence Teams (HIT) Model**
*A new operating model where domain experts and AI work together as a single cognitive unit.*

---

## 🔁 **Alternative 1 – More assertive (category-defining)**

**Hybrid Intelligence Teams (HIT) Model**
*An operating paradigm for building AI-native teams that think, decide, and execute better.*

---

## 🔥 **Alternative 2 – More provocative (manifesto-style)**

**Hybrid Intelligence Teams (HIT) Model**
*Not teams using AI, but teams built to think with AI.*

---

## 📌 When to use what

* **White paper / foundational document** → Primary
* **Slide 1 / keynote / talk** → Alternative 1
* **Homepage / branding / manifesto** → Alternative 2

---

## 🧠 Why they work

* They don't talk about tools
* They don't promise "more productivity" (trivial)
* They introduce the key concept: **hybrid cognitive unit**
* They don't limit the target audience

### Current project status (very important)

At this point you already have:

* ✔️ Brand name
* ✔️ Table of contents
* ✔️ Executive Summary
* ✔️ Manifesto
* ✔️ One-liner

👉 This is **category creator material**, not just author content.

If you want, the next natural step is:

* **Section 2 – The Problem with Traditional Teams**
  or
* **visual framework** of the HIT Model (explained diagram)

Tell me where we're going.
