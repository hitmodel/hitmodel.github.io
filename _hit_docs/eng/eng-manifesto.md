## **Manifesto – Hybrid Intelligence Teams**

Artificial intelligence is not a tool to be added to existing teams. It is a new form of cognitive capability that makes obsolete the organizational models on which modern work has been built. Continuing to treat AI as marginal support means replicating old inefficiencies with more powerful technology. The real limitation is not AI, but the human structures that surround it. For this reason, the future of work is not about adopting AI, but about **designing natively hybrid teams**, capable of thinking and operating differently.

**Hybrid Intelligence Teams** are born from the intentional fusion of domain expertise and artificial intelligence expertise. They are not "AI-enabled" teams, but **AI-native** teams, where people and intelligent systems collaborate as a single cognitive unit. In this model, AI does not replace human judgment nor blindly automate processes: it expands the team's ability to understand complexity, explore possibilities, and make higher-quality decisions. Value emerges from the continuous interaction between human intuition and artificial computation, not from the supremacy of one over the other.

We believe that the competitive advantage of the future will not derive from the size of organizations nor from the amount of technology adopted, but from the quality of collective intelligence that teams are able to generate. Hybrid Intelligence Teams represent a new operating standard for building, deciding, and executing in an AI-native world. They are not a temporary response to a technological trend, but a structural evolution of how work is conceived. Those who adopt this model will not simply use AI better than others: **they will work in a fundamentally different way**.
