We live in a technological paradox. We have access to the most powerful artificial intelligence in history, yet most companies use it like a fancy calculator: a tool to do the same old things, just slightly faster.

This "AI-as-a-Tool" approach has a hard ceiling: it is constrained by existing processes and organizational structures. If the process is flawed, AI will only execute the flaw more efficiently.

### The Paradigm Shift: AI-Native

The **HIT Model (Hybrid Intelligence Teams)** was born to break this ceiling. It's not about giving employees access to ChatGPT. It's about redesigning the atomic unit of intellectual work: the team.

In a hybrid team, AI is not an accessory. It is a teammate. It participates in problem definition, solution exploration, and execution. But for this to work, a new architecture of skills is required.

### The Fusion: Domain + AI

The secret isn't hiring more AI engineers. It's fusing:
1.  **Domain Experts**: Those who deeply understand the "why" and the "what".
2.  **AI Experts**: Those who can translate the "what" into a scalable, computational "how".

Without domain expertise, AI is a powerful engine without a steering wheel. Without AI, domain expertise is a skilled driver in a slow car.

Welcome to the era of Hybrid Teams.
