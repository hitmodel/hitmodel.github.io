A Hybrid Intelligence Team does not work like a traditional team. It doesn't follow linear waterfall processes, but operates through an iterative cycle that continuously fuses human and artificial intelligence.

We have codified this process into **5 Key Phases**:

### 1. Domain Understanding
Everything starts with the **Domain Lead**. AI cannot solve problems it doesn't understand. In this phase, the human expert transfers context, implicit constraints, and "tacit knowledge" to the system. It's not a prompt, it's a context download.

### 2. Problem Modeling
Here the **AI Lead** steps in. The business problem is translated into a computable structure. Variables, objectives, and success metrics are defined. AI supports this phase by identifying patterns in data that would escape the human eye.

### 3. Human-AI Co-Design
The most creative phase. Humans and AI generate solutions in parallel. AI explores the "solution space" simulating scenarios (even extreme ones), while humans curate, filter, and integrate. It is a dialogue, not a passive output.

### 4. Augmented Execution
Once the direction is decided, execution begins. But it's not manual execution. **Hybrid Operators** orchestrate agents and automations to scale the work. What used to take 100 hours now takes 4 hours of strategic supervision.

### 5. Feedback Loop & Scaling
Every cycle generates new data. The system "learns". The model is refined. The knowledge generated is not lost but becomes a proprietary asset of the team for the next cycle.

**The result?** Faster decisions, better informed choices, and execution that scales non-linearly relative to the human resources employed.
