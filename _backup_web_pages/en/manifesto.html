                <strong>Hybrid Intelligence Teams</strong> are born from the intentional fusion of domain expertise and
                artificial intelligence expertise.
                They are not "AI-enabled" teams, but <strong>AI-native</strong> teams, where people and intelligent
                systems collaborate as a single cognitive unit.
            </p>

            <p class="font-light">
                In this model, AI does not replace human judgment nor blindly automate processes:
                it expands the team's ability to understand complexity, explore possibilities, and make higher-quality
                decisions.
            </p>

            <p class="font-light">
                We believe that the competitive advantage of the future will not derive from the size of organizations
                nor from the amount of technology adopted,
                but from the <strong>quality of collective intelligence</strong> that teams are able to generate.
            </p>

            <p class="font-bold">
                Those who adopt this model will not simply use AI better than others: they will work in a fundamentally
                different way.
